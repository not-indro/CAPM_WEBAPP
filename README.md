## Overview

The CAPM Web App is a user-friendly tool built using Streamlit and Python that allows users to perform calculations and visualizations related to the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). CAPM is a widely-used finance theory that helps investors assess the expected return on an investment based on its risk and the overall market conditions.

This web app provides an intuitive interface for users to input relevant data and obtain valuable insights about their investment decisions using the CAPM framework. Users can quickly estimate the expected return of a specific asset, analyze its risk profile, and assess its performance against the market benchmark.

## Features

- **Asset Data Input**: Easily input the necessary data for the asset, including its risk-free rate, beta, and market return.

- **Expected Return Calculation**: Calculate the expected return of the asset based on the provided data and CAPM formula.

- **Risk Assessment**: Evaluate the risk associated with the asset by analyzing its beta and comparing it to the market benchmark.

- **Performance Comparison**: Compare the asset's expected return and risk profile with the overall market conditions to make informed investment decisions.

- **Interactive Visualization**: Visualize the asset's position on the Security Market Line (SML) graph, allowing for a clearer understanding of its risk-return tradeoff.
